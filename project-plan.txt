There will be cards of characters.
These cards will contain information about characters.
Information that should be delivered via cards are as follows:

-Name // The name of the character
-Status // The status of the character('Alive', 'Dead', or 'unknown')
-Species // The species of the character.
-Gender // The gender of the character ('Female', 'Male', 'Genderless' or 'unknown').
-Origin // Name and link to the character's origin location.
-Location // Name and link to the character's last known location endpoint.
-Image // Link to the character's image. All images are 300x300px and most are medium shots or potraits
	// since they are intended to be used as avatars.

There will be filtering options to filter out characters. Filtering variables are as follows:
-Name // filter by given name.
-Status // filter by given status (alive, dead, or unknown).
-species // filter by given species.
-type: // filter by given type.
-gender: // filter by the given gender (female, male, genderless or uknown).

Whole project is this short.
Main goal is to display characters with and without filtering options. Filtering the characters is up to the user.
There may be option to show how mamy characters at maximum should be displayed.
